public class Practice{

}


// final keyword behind a variable to make sure it doesnt change
// public static void method can be accessible in anywhere in the method
// public void method without the static needs an object to call the method

/* Class constructors can be used to access objects. Creating a class constructor
in the name of the class without a static or void. just public and the class name method
e.g class name is public class myClass. the constructor should be public myClass()
